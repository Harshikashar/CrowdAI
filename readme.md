# **Crowd Detection System** 

# **Project Overview**

A web-based Crowd Detection System that uses AI/ML to analyze and visualize crowd levels at different locations. It helps users make informed decisions about when and where to go based on real-time density data and heatmaps.

**Key Features:**

* Real-time crowd prediction

* Dynamic heatmap visualization

* "Try Now" button to test the full system with live backend

* Feedback & alert system

* Smart UI with responsive design

##  **Tech Stack**

* Frontend: React \+ TypeScript \+ Tailwind CSS \+ Vite

* Backend: Python (Flask)

* ML Model: Integrated in the Flask server

**Running the Project Locally**

Make sure you have Node.js, npm, and Python 3.x installed.

### 1️⃣ Start the Frontend

npm install  
npm run dev

Your frontend should now be live at:  
 	📍 http://localhost:8080

### 

### 2️⃣ Start the Backend (Python Flask API)

Open a new terminal window:

cd backend  
python3 app.py

Your backend (API server \+ ML model) will start at:  
	 📍 http://localhost:5001

## 💻 Project Usage

Once both servers are running:

* Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

* Click on “Try Now” to:

  * Send real-time data to the backend

  * Receive crowd predictions

  * View generated heatmaps

* Explore other features like:

  * Upload media with generated heatmap 

  * Crowd alerts

  * Location-based predictions

Make sure your backend is running before using "Try Now" or any real-time feature.
